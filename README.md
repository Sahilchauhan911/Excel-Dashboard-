## Key Questions Answered
- What are the overall sales and order trends over time?

## High‑Level Insights

- A small set of categories contributes a disproportionate share of revenue (Pareto effect), highlighting cross‑sell and upsell opportunities.
- Certain regions and channels outperform, indicating where to prioritize marketing spend.
- Repeat customers significantly impact revenue; loyalty initiatives could improve retention and lifetime value.
